summary: '"Gordon: der Held von Khartum" by Anonymous is a biographical account likely
  written in the late 19th century. This work details the life and achievements of
  Charles George Gordon, a British army officer known for his service in various military
  campaigns, particularly in China and in Africa. The book explores Gordon''s early
  years, his military experiences, and his eventual rise to fame as a figure of heroism
  and moral conviction, especially in the context of his involvement in the Sudan.  The
  opening of the biography presents a brief overview of Gordon''s ancestry and upbringing,
  particularly emphasizing his Scottish heritage and military family. It describes
  his childhood as one marked by contradictions; he was known to be timid and sensitive
  yet exhibited courage and resourcefulness in various childhood exploits. The narrative
  gives insight into the formative experiences that shaped his character, such as
  his participation in the Crimean War, reinforcing themes of duty and faith that
  would define his later life. In this initial section, the groundwork is laid for
  understanding the complexities of Gordon''s personality and the historical backdrop
  against which he developed into a notable military leader. (This is an automatically
  generated summary.)'
